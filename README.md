# Crypto-vs-Stocks-NiFi-Flow

This is a project that I worked on for a course called "Modern Data Architectures". In light of the current level of acceptance of cryptocurrencies, 
with my team, we undertook an assessment of the behaviour of top cryptocurrencies in comparison to other asset classes and commodities. 
The objective was to ascertain whether there exists a correlation among these various financial instruments.
Our primary objective centered around acquiring valuable market data for cryptocurrencies from Binance, with a keen emphasis on facilitating in-depth analysis.
To achieve this, we employed the use of Apache NiFi as our designated data ingestion tool for the purpose of web scraping. 
Through this tool, we extracted pertinent information directly from our predefined source, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process for gathering
cryptocurrency market data from Binance. This strategic approach set the stage for comprehensive analysis, enabling us to derive actionable
insights from the data we collected. We collected data from different asset classes, selecting the top performing stocks and commodities such as gold and silver.
In collecting the relevant data for these assets, we  used an API called MarketStack to extract csv files of these stocks and commodities.
