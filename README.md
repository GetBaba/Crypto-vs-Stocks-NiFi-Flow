# Crypto-vs-Stocks-NiFi-Flow

This is a project that I worked on for a course called "Modern Data Architectures I". With my team, we 

In light of the current level of acceptance of cryptocurrencies, we are undertaking
an assessment of the behaviour of top cryptocurrencies in comparison to other asset
classes and commodities. The objective is to ascertain whether there exists a
correlation among these various financial instruments

Our primary objective centers around acquiring valuable market data for cryptocurrencies from
Binance, with a keen emphasis on facilitating in-depth analysis. To achieve this, we employ the use of
Apache NiFi as our designated data ingestion tool for the purpose of web scraping. Through this
tool, we aim to extract pertinent information directly from our predefined source, ensuring a
streamlined and efficient process for gathering cryptocurrency market data from Binance. This
strategic approach sets the stage for comprehensive analysis, enabling us to derive actionable
insights from the data we collect

We have collected data from different asset classes, we have selected the top performing stocks and
commodities such as gold and silver. In collecting the relevant data for these assets, we have used an
API called MarketStack to extract csv files of these stocks and commodities.
